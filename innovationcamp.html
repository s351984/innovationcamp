	<p class="ttk"> We are a innovative group that goes by the name of Cxmo. We have developed a corona button. This is a button that is going to turn red and peep everytime there is someone 1 meter or closer to the person wearing this. Making sure the customer know that they  are too close to other people, and they should distance themself as quick as possible. Our primary customers will be children in school, and mostly kids in less-developed countries. 
	</p>
		<p class="ttk"> Kids in under-developed countries already have bad resources and fighting a battle against a deadly virus could be lethal for these young childrens, and their families. The numbers in these countries are rocket high, and it's important that the people distance themself from each other. Therefore have we decided to make this button mainly for those in need.
